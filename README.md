# ipad3-3_ios9.3.4_decrypted_IPAs
Ipad 3,3 ios 9.3.4 decrypted/dumped ipa archive. Can install with AppSync etc.

These were a PITA to get - one has to spoof a higher iOS version to get the crApp Store to let you download the newer version that DOESN'T work, then revert to actual iOS version and go back to crap store - it will then prompt you to 'download last compatible version?'.  You then run Clutch against the IPA file so that it can be freely installed without being linked to your all-seeing-Apple overlord account...

How the fuck do these companies get away with this shit.  I for one look forward to eventual legislation that gives end users their digital rights back, it's fucking way out of hand.  A device barely 10 yrs old with all the requisite hardware capabilities is rendered garbage / landfill fillings by these fucking scumbags, it's criminal! They should be tried and convicted for crimes against the planet and humanity.

Note that some files were too big for Microfuck's version of github with 25mb file limit, so they're split zips, your zip app will combine them if you have both numbered files.

Puffin remote Browser (its free no account required) and Workflow (now called 'shortcuts', a macro scripting app) are by far the two coolest things here.  

Anywho, have fun - http://jailbreakme.com works still on 9.3.4 !
